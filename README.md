# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
- I created a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, I used Pandas and Matplotlib to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type to answer how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results:

- We can see on the image above that Rural cities are the ones that have less numbers of rides and drives but their average fare per ride is higher than Suburban and Urban.
- On the other hand we can see that Urban cities are the ones with the most rides and drivers but their their average fare per ride is the lowest of them.

## Summary:

#### Here are three business recommendations to the CEO
1. From the imagens above we can see that are many opportunities to expand business specially in Rural cities
2. Since the Urban cities has a lot of more drivers and the competition makes the fare drops, we should work on a reward plan based on numbers of rides or hours a day working. This way we get to keep the drivers fidelity to our company. 
3. You should create some "first ride" and "first driver" campaing that makes more people intersting on try rides in Rural and Suburban cities and that can even earn and acumulate points if they share with their friends.
